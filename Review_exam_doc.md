## ML Class Sep 5th:  (Class 4)
- Sampling Distributions
-	Deterministic – which can be calculated and given a accurate value. Stone falling from 100m
-	Sarcastic variable - Forecast of weather – close to real value
-	Discreet variable – average time taken to server a customer by a tea vendor
#### Topics :
-	Statistical inference
-	Population parameters and statistics
-	Sampling distributions
-	Sampling distribution of mean
-	Sampling distribution of variance
-	Central limit Theorem
-	Confidence intervals
-	Confidence intervals for means
    •	Large sample (n>=30)
    •	Small samples (n<30)
-	Confidence interval of variances 

-	**What is machine learning**: - A machine performing task T is said to be learning if the performance as measured by P increases with Experience E – Tom Mitchells definition.
-	Measurement of likelihood estimation 
   •	Maximum likelihood estimate function (y - 𝑦̂ , where y is original and y-cap predicted value from model. We try to minimize the error)
   •	Minimum square estimate function (y = mx + c. y and x are independent and identically distributed.)
   •	Gaussian density function -- 𝐹(𝑥) = ∑ 1/ √2𝜋𝜎. 𝑒 (−𝑥−𝜇) 2 /𝜎 2
   •	Basic example where we can use MLE  During a nut bolt manufacturing in a company diameter of bolt is 5 mm, which is instructed to be made. But as lathe machine has some error i.e. due to some limitations, what we get is bolts with 4.5mm or 4.78 mm. So here we are trying to use MLE to bring that value close to 5 mm.
- Types of Techniques in Machine Learning. 
    *  A – Regression. B – Classification. (Major difference OUTPUT of regression is continuous and OUTPUT of classification is discrete.)
-	Examples of Classification 1. Recognizing digits’ problem. 2. Classifying cars. 3. Face recognition
-	Examples of Regression 1. Forecast flow in river, if it has rained some amount in the nearby catchment area. 2. Cost vs Demand. 3. Demand vs Supply
